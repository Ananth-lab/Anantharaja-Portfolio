    Are you living the life you’ve always wanted? Or have you settled into the status quo? If you’ve hit a plateau, feel stuck in life or know that you haven’t reached your full potential, it’s not too late. You can reprogram your mind to give you the focus and determination it takes to design a life that gives you fulfillment, joy and passion.
    Most of us have a vague idea of what we think we deserve. When life veers away from that path we have quietly set for it, we often become frustrated and upset. “Why is this happening?” we wonder. This discontent can be powerful; it can spur us to make change.
    
    But our subconscious minds can also work against us. So many of us end up turning our frustration and upset against ourselves, sabotaging any potential success. We start thinking that we deserve better, and we may work a little harder for a few days. But rather than take action and strive for lasting change, we drop right back down to where we think we belong – in our careers, our finances, our relationships, our health, our general sense of well-being.
