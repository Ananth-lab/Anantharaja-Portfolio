    When I began to learn about coding, I knew that you are either a web developer or a mobile developer – at least, that's what I thought back then.<br>

    So I decided to first learn Android development then later transitioned to web development. I knew that with the skills I had, I was set and ready to apply for jobs.
    
    When I looked over my first job applications, something stood out: they either wanted a front-end developer, back-end developer, or a full-stack developer.<br>
    
    Um, what the heck! All I ever wanted was to be a web developer, or at least I thought that was where everybody began.<br> Seeing those new terms made me feel confused and for a moment I thought I had chosen the wrong path. But no – all I needed was to learn some new terms and I was good to go.
    
    In the past few years the web has become more complex and there are many opportunities for developers with different skills.
